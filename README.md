# MATLAB-Habits-OvertrainingExp2
In this files I have the scripts for running a variation of the program I used in Luque et al 2017.

The current files do work and have been used in the Experiment 1 of a project focused on habitual and goal-directed learning in humans (Experiment 2-conducted in May 2018). The details about these experiments are in my OSF website (https://osf.io/9x3tm/), but now this project is not public (sorry). I will go full public when I finish/publish the preprint (I have results now, and they are cool).

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to chat about this code, or these experiments or whatever (david.luque (at) gmail.com).
